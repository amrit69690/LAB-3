Project Overview
This project is an Express-based Node.js application designed to demonstrate basic server setup, routing, and CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using JSON data. The project is divided into three main files:

groupInfo.js: Displays team member names on the homepage.

dataDisplay.js: Serves JSON data from a file and displays it at a specified route.

crudOperations.js: Provides API endpoints for CRUD operations on the JSON data using Express routes.



Using an API client like Postman to test the following routes:
GET http://localhost:3002/cars – Retrieve all entries.
POST http://localhost:3002/cars – Add a new entry (use JSON format).
PUT http://localhost:3002/cars/:id – Update an entry by ID.
DELETE http://localhost:3002/cars/:id – Delete an entry by ID.
